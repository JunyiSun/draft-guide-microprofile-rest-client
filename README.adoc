= Invoking RESTful services through MicroProfile Rest Client

Learn how to use MicroProfile Rest Client to invoke RESTful services over HTTP in a type-safe way.

// =================================================================================================
// What you'll learn
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to retrieve information from a remote service with MicroProfile Rest Client.
MicroProfile Rest Client provides a type-safe way to call RESTful services so that developers can
focus more on the client models rather than how to connect with remote services while developing
client applications.

The application that you will be working with is an `inventory` service which retrieves and stores the system property information for different hosts.
Whenever a request is made to the `inventory` service to retrieve the
system properties of a particular host, the `inventory` service will create a client to invoke the `system`
service on that host to get these system properties. The `system` service simulates a remote service in this application.

You will learn how to create and register the client interface and handle exceptions through `ResponseExceptionMappers`.
In addition, you will build the implementation of the RESTful client with two approaches: `RestClientBuilder`, or Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI).

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished inventory application. Feel
free to give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then run the following
Maven goals to build the application and run it inside Open Liberty:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

After starting the application, you can access the following two microservices:

* `http://localhost:9080/system/properties` retrieves the information for a specific host

* `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems` retrieves the information for a list of all previously registered hosts

Once you are done checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.

== Writing the RESTful client interface

The MicroProfile Rest Client API was added as a dependency to your `pom.xml` file. Look for the dependency with the `microprofile-rest-client-api` artifact ID.
This feature allows you to use the MicroProfile Rest Client to invoke RESTful services over HTTP in a type-safe way.
The `mpRestClient-1.0` feature is also enabled in the `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` file.

The code for the `system` service in the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system` directory is provided for you. It simulates a remote RESTful service that
the `inventory` service tries to invoke.

Now you need to create a RESTful client interface that represents this `system` service, call it the system client.
Create a `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java` file:
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

Note that the service will automatically build and generate an implementation for the system client interface, because the JAX-RS annotations in this interface tells the RESTful service
what to do. That allows the user to not have to worry about all of the boilerplate code (like setting up a client class, connecting to the remote server, invoking the right URI with the right parameters, etc.).

When the `getProperties()` method gets invoked, the system client sends a GET request to the endpoint at `<baseUrl>/system/properties`.

== Instantiating the client with CDI and Config

Now you need to instantiate the system client and use it in the `inventory` service. It is easy to do so using the CDI and MicroProfile Config approach.

First, you need to configure the `baseUrl` of this system client using MicroProfile Config. The feature has been enabled for you in both `server.xml` and `pom.xml` files.
Open the `finish/pom.xml` file, add a new config property called `<fullyQualifiedInterfaceName>/mp-rest/url` which in this case is `io.openliberty.guides.service.MusicPlaylistService/mp-rest/url` to the `<bootstrapProperties>` field and
configure this property to the default base URL `http://localhost:9080/system/properties`. This configuration will be automatically picked up by the MicroProfile Config API.

Then, update the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java` file with a few more annotations:
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

`@Dependent` tells the service the scope of this interface.

`@RegisterRestClient` registers this interface as a rest client.

`@RegisterProvider()` adds any provider classes to this interface; you can add as many providers as necessary.

Inject the system client to the `InventoryResource` class using CDI. Copy all the following code and replace the contents of the `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java` file:
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/InventoryResource.java[tags=**;!copyright;]
----

`@RestClient` implies that CDI injects an instance of the `system` Rest Client to the service.

Now you can invoke the `system` service by calling the `systemClient.getProperties()` method.

Once the server is running, the following two microservices should be available to access:

* `http://localhost:9080/system/properties`

* `http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems`

// Testing the application
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the application

Create a `src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/client/RestClientTest.java` file and add the following code:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/client/RestClientTest.java[tags=test]
----

In addition, a few endpoint tests have been provided for you to test the basic functionality of the `inventory` and `system` services. If a test failure occurs, then you must have introduced a bug into the code.

To see whether the tests detect a failure ......
Re-run the Maven build. You will see a test failure occur.

== Great work! You're done!

You just built and tested a MicroProfile application with MicroProfile Rest Client and Open Liberty.

expand on top what you built in this guide.
